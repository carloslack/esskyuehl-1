Esskyuehl (ESQL) is a completely asynchronous client-side SQL library.
It robustly supports both event-driven and callback-driven models for
handling responses, and it uses a dynamic module-loading interface for
its SQL server compatibility.

Dependencies:
eina
ecore
mysql (optional)
postgresql (optional)

Install:
Simply run autogen.sh to configure, 'make' to the code, and 'make install' to install

Tests:
Run 'make check' to compile the tests. By default, both mysql and psql modes are tested
in each app.
